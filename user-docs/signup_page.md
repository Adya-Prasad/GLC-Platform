# User Login & Registration Guide

Welcome to the Green Lending Cycle (GLC) Platform! This guide will help you get started with creating an account and logging in securely.

To access the platform, navigate to the login page. You will see two primary options:

- **Enter as Borrower**: For companies seeking green loans.
- **Enter as Lender / Bank**: For financial institutions reviewing loan applications.

## 2. Creating a New Account

We've simplified the registration process for the hackathon. You don't need email verification!

1. **Select your Role**: Click on either "Enter as Borrower" or "Enter as Lender".
2. **Enter Organization Name**: Type your company or bank name.
3. **Create a Passcode**: Enter a new **6-digit passcode**.
   - *Tip: Remember this passcode! You will need it to log in again.*
4. **Click Continue**: The system will automatically create your account and log you in.

> **Note**: You will see a "🎉 Welcome!" message confirming your new account.

## 3. Logging In (Existing Users)

If you already created an account:

1. **Select your Role**.
2. **Enter your Organization Name** (exactly as you created it).
3. **Enter your 6-digit Passcode**.
4. **Click Continue**.

> **Note**: You will see a "✅ Welcome back!" message if your login is successful.

## 4. Troubleshooting

- **"Incorrect passcode" error**: Double-check you entered the correct 6 digits. If you forgot it, try creating a new account with a slightly different name (e.g., "Green Corp 2").
- **"Network Error"**: Ensure the server is running and you have an internet connection.
