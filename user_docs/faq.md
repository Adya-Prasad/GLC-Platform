### Q1. What is Baseline Error?

A Baseline Year in emissions reduction is the chosen starting point, a specific historical year with documented greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, used as a benchmark to measure future progress and track how much an organization has reduced its carbon footprint. Targets, like "reduce emissions by 50% by 2030," are always relative to this baseline (e.g., 50% less than the emissions in the baseline year), providing a consistent standard for evaluating success.
