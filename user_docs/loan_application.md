# Loan Application Guide

This guide walks you through the process of submitting a new green loan application on the GLC Platform.

## 1. Starting a New Application

Navigate to **"New Application"** in the sidebar. You will see a form requiring project details.

### Step 1: Project Information
Fill in the core details of your green project:
- **Project Name**: a descriptive title.
- **Sector**: e.g., Renewable Energy, Green Buildings, Clean Transportation.
- **Loan Amount**: Requested capital in USD.

### Step 2: Use of Proceeds
Refencing **Green Loan Principles (GLP)**, clearly describe how the funds will be used.
*Example: "Construction of a 50MW solar verification plant in Arizona."*

## 2. Uploading Documents

The platform uses AI to analyze your documents. Upload evidence to support your application:

- **project_plan.pdf**: Detailed engineering or business plan.
- **environmental_impact.pdf**: Initial assessments.
- **permits.pdf**: Local government approvals.

> **Important**: Ensure documents are clear PDFs. Our AI agents will scan these to automatically verify your GLP eligibility!

## 3. Submission & Review

Once submitted:
1. **Status**: Changes to "Submitted".
2. **AI Processing**: The system automatically scans your docs for:
   - *Use of Proceeds* alignment
   - *DNSH (Do No Significant Harm)* criteria
   - *Carbon Lock-in* risks
3. **Lender Review**: A human lender reviews the AI's scorecard and makes the final decision.

## 4. Tracking Status

Go to **"My Applications"** to see real-time updates:
- **Pending**: Under review.
- **Approved**: Loan granted!
- **Rejected**: See feedback for reasons (usually missing documents or GLP misalignment).
