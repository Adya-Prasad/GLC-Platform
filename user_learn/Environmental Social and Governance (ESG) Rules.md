# Understanding the "Rules" of Green Lending within ESG
Green lending is a critical component of sustainable finance within the broader ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) landscape. It's less about rigid, globally mandated laws and more about voluntary, market-driven frameworks that ensure integrity and transparency.
The primary "rules" are the Green Loan Principles (GLP), a voluntary framework developed by industry associations like the Loan Market Association (LMA). These principles act as a standard for what qualifies as a legitimate "green loan" and are designed to prevent greenwashing.
## The Four Core Principles:
- Use of Proceeds: Funds must be exclusively earmarked for projects with clear environmental benefits (e.g., renewable energy, sustainable waste management, green buildings).
- Project Evaluation: Borrowers must clearly articulate their environmental objectives and the process used to select eligible projects, including managing associated risks.
- Management of Proceeds: Funds must be tracked in a transparent manner, ensuring they are credited to a dedicated account or managed through an auditable internal process.
- Reporting: Borrowers are required to provide regular reports to lenders detailing how the money was used and the quantified environmental impact of the project.

### Green Loans vs. Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs)
It's important to differentiate:
- Green Loans are project-specific. The "rule" is the use of the money for that single purpose.
- SLLs are general corporate purpose loans where the interest rate is tied to the borrower meeting predefined, company-wide ESG performance targets (SPTs).

In essence, the "rules" of green lending are a set of best practices that promote accountability, transparency, and a genuine, positive environmental impact in the financial world.
